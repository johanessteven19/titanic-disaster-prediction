# Titanic Disaster Prediction

Using data from the Titanic disaster available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data), trained two different classifier models:
- XGBoost classifier
- CatBoost classifier

Both models have hyper-parameters adjusted to best performance according to the accuracy score.

XGBoost classifier got a score of 0.76555, while CatBoost got 0.77751, which are enough to place 4297th out of 17,441 participants (top 25%).
